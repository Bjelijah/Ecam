 * g_base64_encode_step:
 * @in: the binary data to encode
 * @len: the length of @in
 * @break_lines: whether to break long lines
 * @out: pointer to destination buffer
 * @state: Saved state between steps, initialize to 0
 * @save: Saved state between steps, initialize to 0
 *
 * Incrementally encode a sequence of binary data into its Base-64 stringified
 * representation. By calling this function multiple times you can convert 
 * data in chunks to avoid having to have the full encoded data in memory.
 *
 * When all of the data has been converted you must call 
 * g_base64_encode_close() to flush the saved state.
 *
 * The output buffer must be large enough to fit all the data that will
 * be written to it. Due to the way base64 encodes you will need
 * at least: (@len / 3 + 1) * 4 + 4 bytes (+ 4 may be needed in case of
 * non-zero state). If you enable line-breaking you will need at least:
 * ((@len / 3 + 1) * 4 + 4) / 72 + 1 bytes of extra space.
 *
 * @break_lines is typically used when putting base64-encoded data in emails.
 * It breaks the lines at 72 columns instead of putting all of the text on 
 * the same line. This avoids problems with long lines in the email system.
 *
 * Return value: The number of bytes of output that was written
 *
 * Since: 2.12
